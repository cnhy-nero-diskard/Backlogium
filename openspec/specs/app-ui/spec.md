# app-ui

## Purpose

Defines the Android app's UI behavior: the app shell and navigation, the Home screen,
visual theming, typography, iconography, game art states, celebratory animations, the
Library screen, the History screen, and sync feedback on Home.

## Requirements

### Requirement: App shell and navigation
The system SHALL present a Compose UI with navigation between Home, Library, and
History screens, and all screens SHALL render from locally stored state so the app
is fully usable offline.

#### Scenario: Offline launch
- **WHEN** the app is opened without network
- **THEN** all screens display the last synced state and never block on a network call

#### Scenario: Navigating between screens
- **WHEN** the user selects a destination from the app's navigation
- **THEN** the corresponding screen (Home, Library, or History) is shown

### Requirement: Home screen
The system SHALL provide a Home screen showing the player's level and XP progress,
today's daily quest status, the current streak, and a "Now playing" indicator reflecting
the player's current in-game state.

#### Scenario: Viewing progress
- **WHEN** the Home screen is shown
- **THEN** it displays current level with progress toward the next level, whether today's quest is met, and the current streak count

#### Scenario: Sync now from Home
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Sync now" from Home
- **THEN** a manual poll is enqueued and the screen reflects updated state and any sync error when it completes

#### Scenario: Now playing shown while in-game
- **WHEN** the live status reports the player is in a game
- **THEN** the Home screen shows a "Now playing" indicator with the running game's name
  (and its icon when resolvable)

#### Scenario: Now playing hidden when not in-game
- **WHEN** the live status reports the player is not in a game
- **THEN** the Home screen does not show a "Now playing" indicator

### Requirement: Custom dark visual theme
The system SHALL render all screens using a hand-authored dark color scheme (charcoal/
navy surfaces with a single gold/amber accent) and SHALL NOT use Android dynamic
(wallpaper-derived) color, so the app's appearance is identical across devices.

#### Scenario: Consistent appearance regardless of device wallpaper
- **WHEN** the app is launched on an Android 12+ device with dynamic color available
- **THEN** the app renders using the custom color scheme, not a wallpaper-derived one

#### Scenario: Consistent appearance across OS versions
- **WHEN** the app is launched on a device below Android 12
- **THEN** the app renders using the same custom color scheme used on newer devices

### Requirement: Display typography for numeral moments
The system SHALL render level number, streak count, and XP total text using a distinct
display font, and SHALL render all other text using a bundled brand body font. No text
SHALL fall back to the platform system default font.

#### Scenario: Level number uses display font
- **WHEN** the Home screen shows the player's level number
- **THEN** it is rendered in the display font, not the body font or the system default font

#### Scenario: Body text uses the brand body font
- **WHEN** any screen renders body, caption, title, or label text (e.g. section
  headers, list rows, dialog text, navigation labels)
- **THEN** it is rendered in the bundled brand body font, not the platform system default font

#### Scenario: Offline availability preserved
- **WHEN** the app runs with no network connectivity
- **THEN** both the display font and the brand body font render from bundled resources,
  with no downloadable-font dependency

### Requirement: App-wide icon set
The system SHALL represent navigation destinations and status indicators using icons
from a single icon library, and SHALL NOT use emoji characters for these purposes.

#### Scenario: Navigation bar icons
- **WHEN** the bottom navigation bar is shown
- **THEN** Home, Library, and History are each represented by an icon from the chosen
  icon library instead of an emoji character

#### Scenario: Status glyphs
- **WHEN** a status indicator is shown (streak, quest completion state)
- **THEN** it is represented by an icon from the chosen icon library instead of an
  emoji character

### Requirement: Game art loading and error states
The system SHALL display a themed placeholder while a game's icon image is loading,
and a themed fallback icon if the image fails to load, on both the Library screen's
goal and backlog game rows.

#### Scenario: Icon still loading
- **WHEN** a game row is displayed and its icon image has not finished loading
- **THEN** a themed placeholder is shown in place of the icon

#### Scenario: Icon fails to load
- **WHEN** a game row's icon image fails to load (network error or invalid URL)
- **THEN** a themed fallback icon is shown instead of a blank space

### Requirement: Celebratory inline animations
The system SHALL play an inline animation within the Home screen's Level card when the
player's level increments, and SHALL play an inline animation within the Home screen's
Streak card when the current streak reaches a milestone interval of every 7 days.

#### Scenario: Level increments
- **WHEN** the player's level increases from its previous value
- **THEN** an inline animation plays within the Level card

#### Scenario: Streak reaches a weekly milestone
- **WHEN** the current streak's day count is a positive multiple of 7
- **THEN** an inline animation plays within the Streak card

#### Scenario: Streak not at a milestone
- **WHEN** the current streak's day count is not a multiple of 7
- **THEN** no milestone animation plays within the Streak card

### Requirement: Library screen
The system SHALL provide a Library screen separating tagged goal games from backlog
games, and SHALL allow marking a game as a goal and unmarking it. Goal games SHALL
display progress against a HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length when one is available,
and SHALL display no completion-based progress when it is not.

#### Scenario: Goal game with an HLTB length shows progress
- **WHEN** the Library is shown and a goal game has a HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length
- **THEN** the goal game displays its name, icon, and playtime, and a progress indicator measuring its playtime against that completion length

#### Scenario: Goal game without an HLTB length shows no progress
- **WHEN** the Library is shown and a goal game has no HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length yet
- **THEN** the goal game displays its name, icon, and playtime, and does not display completion-based progress

#### Scenario: Marking a game as a goal
- **WHEN** the user marks a backlog game as a goal, or unmarks a goal game
- **THEN** the game moves between the goal and backlog sections and the change persists,
  without prompting for a typed target

### Requirement: Refresh HowLongToBeat library trigger
The system SHALL provide a manual control to refresh HowLongToBeat data across the library, reflect that a refresh is running, and report its completion.

#### Scenario: Triggering a refresh
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Refresh HLTB library"
- **THEN** a batch refresh is enqueued and the user can leave the screen while it continues running

#### Scenario: Refresh completes
- **WHEN** a batch refresh completes
- **THEN** the user is informed of completion and any games needing review become available in the review surface

### Requirement: Per-game HowLongToBeat status and refresh
The system SHALL show each game's HowLongToBeat lookup state in the Library and SHALL let the user trigger a fresh single-game lookup, distinguishing a lookup in progress, a failed lookup, and a stored match result.

#### Scenario: Per-game status is visible
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game that has stored HowLongToBeat data (matched, needing review, or no match) or an in-progress lookup
- **THEN** the game displays its current HowLongToBeat state

#### Scenario: Refreshing a single game
- **WHEN** the user triggers a HowLongToBeat refresh for a single game
- **THEN** the system performs a fresh lookup for that game regardless of cached data and reflects the in-progress state while it runs

#### Scenario: Single-game lookup fails
- **WHEN** a single-game HowLongToBeat lookup fails
- **THEN** the failure is surfaced for that game and its cached HowLongToBeat data is not overwritten or cleared

### Requirement: HLTB match review
The system SHALL provide a surface listing games flagged as needing an HLTB match, and SHALL let the user open a flagged game and select the correct HowLongToBeat entry from its candidates.

#### Scenario: Reviewing flagged games
- **WHEN** the user opens the match-review surface and games are flagged as needing review
- **THEN** each flagged game is listed with its candidate HowLongToBeat entries available for selection

#### Scenario: Confirming a match
- **WHEN** the user selects the correct candidate for a flagged game
- **THEN** the game is marked resolved, its completion length becomes available to the goal and gamification features, and it is removed from the review list

#### Scenario: No games need review
- **WHEN** the user opens the match-review surface and no games are flagged
- **THEN** the surface indicates there is nothing to review

### Requirement: Game detail screen with achievements
The system SHALL provide a game detail screen, reachable by selecting a game from the
Library, that lists that game's achievements with each achievement's unlock state, rarity
tier, and the XP it contributes, using its display name and icon when available.

#### Scenario: Opening a game's detail
- **WHEN** the user selects a game in the Library
- **THEN** a detail screen for that game is shown listing its achievements

#### Scenario: Achievement rarity and XP shown
- **WHEN** the detail screen shows an unlocked achievement that has a rarity snapshot
- **THEN** it displays the achievement's rarity tier and the XP it contributes

#### Scenario: Locked achievement shown without XP
- **WHEN** the detail screen shows a locked achievement
- **THEN** it is displayed as locked and shows no XP contribution

#### Scenario: Game without achievement data
- **WHEN** the user opens the detail for a game that has no stored achievements
- **THEN** the screen indicates there are no achievements to show rather than appearing broken

### Requirement: Per-game achievement count on Library rows
The system SHALL display, on each Library game row that has stored achievement data, a
compact count of unlocked achievements out of that game's total.

#### Scenario: Row shows unlocked-of-total count
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game with stored achievement data
- **THEN** the row displays how many of the game's achievements are unlocked out of its total

#### Scenario: Row without achievement data
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game with no stored achievement data
- **THEN** the row shows no achievement count and is otherwise unchanged

### Requirement: Distinct visual signal for a fully-completed game
The system SHALL visually distinguish a game whose achievements are all unlocked from one
that is merely in progress, both on its Library row and on its detail screen.

#### Scenario: Fully-completed game stands out on the Library row
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game whose unlocked achievement count equals its total (and
  that total is greater than zero)
- **THEN** the row displays a distinct "100% Completed" indicator in place of the plain
  unlocked-of-total count

#### Scenario: Fully-completed game is announced on its detail screen
- **WHEN** the user opens the detail screen for a game whose achievements are all unlocked
- **THEN** the screen displays a prominent completion banner distinct from the per-achievement
  list

#### Scenario: In-progress game shows no completion signal
- **WHEN** a game has stored achievement data but its unlocked count is less than its total
- **THEN** neither the Library row nor the detail screen displays the completion indicator

### Requirement: Sync-in-progress feedback on Home
The system SHALL reflect an in-flight manual sync on the Home screen: while a "Sync now"
poll is running, the trigger control SHALL show a progress indicator and be disabled,
and SHALL return to its idle state when the poll completes.

#### Scenario: Sync in progress
- **WHEN** the user triggers "Sync now" and the poll has not yet completed
- **THEN** the sync control shows a progress indicator and is disabled so it cannot be
  triggered again

#### Scenario: Sync completes
- **WHEN** an in-flight sync completes (successfully or with an error)
- **THEN** the sync control returns to its enabled idle state and the screen reflects the
  updated last-sync time or any sync error

### Requirement: History screen
The system SHALL provide a History screen listing recently synthesized sessions and
per-day play statistics.

#### Scenario: Recent sessions
- **WHEN** the History screen is shown
- **THEN** it lists recent sessions with game, date, and duration, most recent first

#### Scenario: Daily stats
- **WHEN** daily progress exists
- **THEN** the screen shows per-day totals and whether each day's quest was met

### Requirement: Import Steam history control
The system SHALL provide a control that lets the user import their historical Steam playtime,
and SHALL reflect whether history has already been imported so the action is clearly one-time.

#### Scenario: Offering the import
- **WHEN** the user has not yet imported historical playtime
- **THEN** the UI presents a control to import Steam history

#### Scenario: Reflecting completed import
- **WHEN** historical playtime has already been imported
- **THEN** the control reflects the imported state rather than offering the import again as if unused

#### Scenario: Communicating the effect before importing
- **WHEN** the user is about to import history
- **THEN** the UI indicates that importing counts past playtime toward XP and is a one-time action

#### Scenario: Resetting a completed import
- **WHEN** historical playtime has been imported
- **THEN** the UI offers a control to reset the import, and after resetting the import is
  offered again
