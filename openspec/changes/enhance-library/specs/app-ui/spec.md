## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Library screen
The system SHALL provide a Library screen separating a curated, actively-tracked set of games from
the rest of the library, and SHALL allow adding a game to that set and removing it. Any game SHALL
display progress against a HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length when one is available, whether or
not it belongs to the curated set, and SHALL display no completion-based progress when none is
available. The curated set SHALL be labelled in terms of active tracking rather than in terms of a
user-entered target, since no such target is collected, and the remaining games SHALL be labelled
without implying that they are unplayed or awaiting play.

#### Scenario: Game with an HLTB length shows progress
- **WHEN** the Library is shown and a game has a HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length
- **THEN** the game displays its name, icon, and playtime, and a progress indicator measuring its
  playtime against that completion length, regardless of whether it belongs to the curated set

#### Scenario: Game without an HLTB length shows no progress
- **WHEN** the Library is shown and a game has no HowLongToBeat-sourced completion length yet
- **THEN** the game displays its name, icon, and playtime, and does not display completion-based
  progress

#### Scenario: Adding a game to the tracked set
- **WHEN** the user adds a game to the tracked set, or removes one from it
- **THEN** the game moves between the tracked section and the rest of the library and the change
  persists, without prompting for a typed target

#### Scenario: Tracked games appear once
- **WHEN** a game belongs to the tracked set
- **THEN** it appears only in the tracked section and not also among the remaining games

#### Scenario: Labelling free of an implied target
- **WHEN** the tracked section and its actions are presented
- **THEN** their labels describe active tracking, and no label implies a completion target set by the
  user

#### Scenario: Remaining games labelled without implying they are unplayed
- **WHEN** the section holding games outside the tracked set is presented
- **THEN** its label does not describe those games as a backlog or as awaiting play, since a game with
  substantial playtime and visible completion progress can belong to it

#### Scenario: Tracked minutes still accounted separately
- **WHEN** playtime is recorded for a game in the tracked set
- **THEN** it continues to be accounted separately in per-day progress and reflected in History, as
  it is today

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-list Library sorting
The system SHALL let the user choose the sort order of each Library list independently, offering at
least playtime, name, recent activity, and contributed XP, and SHALL remember each list's chosen order
between visits.

#### Scenario: Sorting a list
- **WHEN** the user chooses a sort order for a Library list
- **THEN** that list is reordered accordingly and the other list's order is unaffected

#### Scenario: Available orders
- **WHEN** the sort options for a list are presented
- **THEN** they include ordering by playtime, by name, by recent activity, and by contributed XP

#### Scenario: Order remembered
- **WHEN** the user leaves the Library and returns
- **THEN** each list is still ordered as the user last chose

#### Scenario: Default orders
- **WHEN** the user has never chosen a sort order
- **THEN** each list uses its existing default order

#### Scenario: Stable ordering
- **WHEN** two games compare equal under the chosen sort key
- **THEN** their relative order is determined consistently rather than arbitrarily

#### Scenario: Games missing the sort key
- **WHEN** a list is sorted by a key that some games have no value for
- **THEN** those games are ordered last rather than being omitted or placed arbitrarily

#### Scenario: Sorting combined with search
- **WHEN** a search filter is active
- **THEN** the matching games are presented in the chosen sort order

### Requirement: Library search
The system SHALL provide a name search that filters the Library, preserving the section structure
for sections that still contain matches.

#### Scenario: Filtering by name
- **WHEN** the user enters text in the Library search
- **THEN** only games whose names contain that text, ignoring case, are shown

#### Scenario: Sections preserved while filtering
- **WHEN** a filter is active and matches exist in more than one section
- **THEN** each section with matches keeps its heading

#### Scenario: No matches
- **WHEN** a filter matches no games
- **THEN** an empty state explains that no games match, rather than showing a blank list

#### Scenario: Clearing the filter
- **WHEN** the user clears the search
- **THEN** the full Library is shown again

### Requirement: Per-game XP contribution badge
The system SHALL show, for each game in the Library, the total XP that game has contributed to the
player's total — its tapered playtime XP plus the XP from its unlocked achievements — such that the
displayed values are consistent with the player's total XP.

#### Scenario: Showing contributed XP
- **WHEN** a game has contributed XP
- **THEN** its row displays that contribution as a compact badge

#### Scenario: Game with no tracked playtime
- **WHEN** a game has no tracked playtime and no imported history and no unlocked achievements
- **THEN** its badge reflects a zero contribution rather than being derived from lifetime Steam
  playtime

#### Scenario: Contribution is not proportional to lifetime playtime
- **WHEN** a game's lifetime Steam playtime greatly exceeds its tracked playtime, or its playtime
  XP has been tapered
- **THEN** the badge still reflects the game's actual XP contribution, and is labelled as
  contributed XP rather than implying a per-hour rate

### Requirement: Batch HowLongToBeat refresh progress
The system SHALL show the progress of a running HowLongToBeat batch refresh, including how many
games have been processed out of the total, and a log of each processed game with its outcome.

#### Scenario: Progress while refreshing
- **WHEN** a batch refresh is running
- **THEN** the Library shows the number of games processed out of the total as a progress indicator

#### Scenario: Per-game log
- **WHEN** each game in the batch is processed
- **THEN** a log entry names the game and its outcome: matched, needs review, no match, or lookup
  failed

#### Scenario: Progress survives leaving the screen
- **WHEN** the user leaves the Library while a refresh is running and returns
- **THEN** the progress indicator reflects the refresh's current position, and the log resumes from
  that point rather than showing entries from before the screen was left

#### Scenario: Refresh completes
- **WHEN** the batch refresh finishes
- **THEN** the progress indicator resolves and the controls become available again

### Requirement: Targeted HowLongToBeat refresh
The system SHALL let the user select multiple games in the Library and run a HowLongToBeat refresh
over only that selection.

#### Scenario: Entering selection mode
- **WHEN** the user long-presses a game row
- **THEN** selection mode is entered with that game selected, and the number of selected games is
  shown

#### Scenario: Refreshing the selection
- **WHEN** the user runs the HowLongToBeat lookup on a selection
- **THEN** only the selected games are refreshed

#### Scenario: Selection preserved while filtering
- **WHEN** a search filter hides a selected game
- **THEN** it remains part of the selection, and the visible selected count continues to include it

#### Scenario: Leaving selection mode
- **WHEN** the user clears the selection or navigates away
- **THEN** selection mode is exited and no selection is retained

#### Scenario: Tap behavior unchanged
- **WHEN** the user taps a game row while not in selection mode
- **THEN** the game's detail screen opens as it does today
