## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Custom dark visual theme
The system SHALL render all screens using a hand-authored dark color scheme (charcoal/
navy surfaces with a single gold/amber accent) and SHALL NOT use Android dynamic
(wallpaper-derived) color, so the app's appearance is identical across devices.

#### Scenario: Consistent appearance regardless of device wallpaper
- **WHEN** the app is launched on an Android 12+ device with dynamic color available
- **THEN** the app renders using the custom color scheme, not a wallpaper-derived one

#### Scenario: Consistent appearance across OS versions
- **WHEN** the app is launched on a device below Android 12
- **THEN** the app renders using the same custom color scheme used on newer devices

### Requirement: Display typography for numeral moments
The system SHALL render level number, streak count, and XP total text using a distinct
display font, while all other text SHALL continue to use the system default font.

#### Scenario: Level number uses display font
- **WHEN** the Home screen shows the player's level number
- **THEN** it is rendered in the display font, not the system default font

#### Scenario: Body text unaffected
- **WHEN** any screen renders body or caption text (e.g. captions, section headers,
  dialog text)
- **THEN** it continues to render in the system default font

### Requirement: App-wide icon set
The system SHALL represent navigation destinations and status indicators using icons
from a single icon library, and SHALL NOT use emoji characters for these purposes.

#### Scenario: Navigation bar icons
- **WHEN** the bottom navigation bar is shown
- **THEN** Home, Library, and History are each represented by an icon from the chosen
  icon library instead of an emoji character

#### Scenario: Status glyphs
- **WHEN** a status indicator is shown (streak, quest completion state)
- **THEN** it is represented by an icon from the chosen icon library instead of an
  emoji character

### Requirement: Game art loading and error states
The system SHALL display a themed placeholder while a game's icon image is loading,
and a themed fallback icon if the image fails to load, on both the Library screen's
goal and backlog game rows.

#### Scenario: Icon still loading
- **WHEN** a game row is displayed and its icon image has not finished loading
- **THEN** a themed placeholder is shown in place of the icon

#### Scenario: Icon fails to load
- **WHEN** a game row's icon image fails to load (network error or invalid URL)
- **THEN** a themed fallback icon is shown instead of a blank space

### Requirement: Celebratory inline animations
The system SHALL play an inline animation within the Home screen's Level card when the
player's level increments, and SHALL play an inline animation within the Home screen's
Streak card when the current streak reaches a milestone interval of every 7 days.

#### Scenario: Level increments
- **WHEN** the player's level increases from its previous value
- **THEN** an inline animation plays within the Level card

#### Scenario: Streak reaches a weekly milestone
- **WHEN** the current streak's day count is a positive multiple of 7
- **THEN** an inline animation plays within the Streak card

#### Scenario: Streak not at a milestone
- **WHEN** the current streak's day count is not a multiple of 7
- **THEN** no milestone animation plays within the Streak card
