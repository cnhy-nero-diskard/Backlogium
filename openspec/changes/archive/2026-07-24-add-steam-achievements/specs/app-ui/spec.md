## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Game detail screen with achievements
The system SHALL provide a game detail screen, reachable by selecting a game from the
Library, that lists that game's achievements with each achievement's unlock state, rarity
tier, and the XP it contributes, using its display name and icon when available.

#### Scenario: Opening a game's detail
- **WHEN** the user selects a game in the Library
- **THEN** a detail screen for that game is shown listing its achievements

#### Scenario: Achievement rarity and XP shown
- **WHEN** the detail screen shows an unlocked achievement that has a rarity snapshot
- **THEN** it displays the achievement's rarity tier and the XP it contributes

#### Scenario: Locked achievement shown without XP
- **WHEN** the detail screen shows a locked achievement
- **THEN** it is displayed as locked and shows no XP contribution

#### Scenario: Game without achievement data
- **WHEN** the user opens the detail for a game that has no stored achievements
- **THEN** the screen indicates there are no achievements to show rather than appearing broken

### Requirement: Per-game achievement count on Library rows
The system SHALL display, on each Library game row that has stored achievement data, a
compact count of unlocked achievements out of that game's total.

#### Scenario: Row shows unlocked-of-total count
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game with stored achievement data
- **THEN** the row displays how many of the game's achievements are unlocked out of its total

#### Scenario: Row without achievement data
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game with no stored achievement data
- **THEN** the row shows no achievement count and is otherwise unchanged

### Requirement: Distinct visual signal for a fully-completed game
The system SHALL visually distinguish a game whose achievements are all unlocked from one
that is merely in progress, both on its Library row and on its detail screen.

#### Scenario: Fully-completed game stands out on the Library row
- **WHEN** the Library shows a game whose unlocked achievement count equals its total (and
  that total is greater than zero)
- **THEN** the row displays a distinct "100% Completed" indicator in place of the plain
  unlocked-of-total count

#### Scenario: Fully-completed game is announced on its detail screen
- **WHEN** the user opens the detail screen for a game whose achievements are all unlocked
- **THEN** the screen displays a prominent completion banner distinct from the per-achievement
  list

#### Scenario: In-progress game shows no completion signal
- **WHEN** a game has stored achievement data but its unlocked count is less than its total
- **THEN** neither the Library row nor the detail screen displays the completion indicator
