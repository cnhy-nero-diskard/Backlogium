# Follow up on PR Review Feedback

Take a PR (link or number), find the review/feedback comments on it, and resolve them
fully on the PR's head branch â€” the agent commits and pushes on its own discretion.

## Overview

1. **Resolve the PR** â€” from the given link/number, or pick from the open PRs.
2. **Move to the PR head branch** â€” fixes land where they are being reviewed.
3. **Read the feedback** â€” unresolved review threads on the current head.
4. **Gate on emptiness** â€” nothing on head? Reject ("there's no comment in the PR
   thread") â€” unless the user explicitly pointed at a thread that is not on the head,
   in which case scour the full history and let them pick.
5. **Resolve** â€” implement each piece of feedback to completion.
6. **Verify, commit, push** â€” autonomously, in coherent increments.
7. **Report** â€” feedback item â†’ action â†’ commit SHA.

### 1. Resolve the PR

- If the user gave a PR number (`#87`, `87`) or URL
  (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>`), use it.
- Otherwise run:
  ```bash
  gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName
  ```
  and present the active PRs (number, title, branch) for the user to choose which
  one they meant. **Do not guess or auto-select a PR.**
- Confirm the PR and read its metadata:
  ```bash
  gh pr view <number> --json number,title,state,headRefName,baseRefName,reviewDecision,url
  ```
  If the PR is not `OPEN`, report that and stop.

### 2. Move to the PR head branch

Check out the head branch so the fixes land on the branch being reviewed. If that
branch is already checked out in a separate worktree, switch to that worktree
directory instead:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <head-branch>     # or: cd <path-to-worktree>
git pull --ff-only             # align with the remote PR head
```

If the local branch has diverged and cannot fast-forward, stop and ask â€” never
rewrite or reset it on your own.

### 3. Read the review feedback (on-head scope first)

Get the base repo owner/name (needed for the GraphQL query):

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
```

Dump every review thread with its resolution and freshness flags:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $number) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            isOutdated
            comments(first: 100) {
              nodes { author { login } body path line createdAt }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=<owner> -f repo=<repo> -F number=<n>
```

Also cross-check review bodies and top-level conversation comments:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json reviews
gh pr view <number> --comments
```

**Feedback in scope (default):**

- Review threads with `isResolved: false` on the current head â€” the outstanding
  review comments.
- Review bodies (e.g. `CHANGES_REQUESTED`) and conversation comments that ask for
  concrete changes.
- Ignore thanks/acknowledgement-only comments â€” they are not actionable feedback.

### 4. Gate: no comments on the head

If step 3 yields no actionable feedback, **reject the prompt**: report that there's no
comment in the PR thread (include PR number, title, URL) and stop. Make no changes.

**Exception â€” the user explicitly said the feedback is in a thread that is not on
the current head** (wording like "it's in an old review", "before the last push",
"an outdated thread", "the comment is gone from the current diff"). Only then scour
the full history:

1. Use the step-3 thread dump, but include **all** threads regardless of
   `isResolved`/`isOutdated` â€” also resolved ones and ones anchored to superseded
   commits.
2. Present every feedback comment as a numbered list: author, date, `path:line`
   (when present), outdated/head marker, and the first lines of the comment body.
3. **Let the user pick which one they meant. Never auto-select.**

Continue to step 5 with the picked comment(s) only.

### 5. Resolve the feedback fully

For each in-scope or picked comment:

1. Read the comment, the code it references (`path`, `line`), and the surrounding
   context. When behaviour is in question, read the normative spec under
   `openspec/specs/` first â€” specs win over implementation.
2. Implement the requested change **completely**. No partial fixes, no leftover
   `TODO`s, no "left for later". If the comment asks for a test, add the test.
3. Keep the change in the scope of the feedback â€” no drive-by refactors or
   unrelated edits.
4. Verify before committing:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :gamification:test :app:testDebugUnitTest   # when the Kotlin side changed
   ./gradlew assembleDebug                               # compilation sanity, when warranted
   npm --prefix functions run build                      # when functions/ changed
   ```

If a comment demands behaviour that conflicts with a normative spec in
`openspec/specs/`, stop and ask â€” spec-behaviour changes go through an OpenSpec
change (`openspec-propose`), never a silent spec edit.

### 6. Commit and push (agent discretion)

Exercise commit/push autonomy: the agent decides, without asking, how to group the
fixes into coherent commits and pushes them when a coherent unit is verified.

1. Stage only the files that belong to the addressed feedback:
   ```bash
   git add <files-for-one-feedback-item>
   git commit -m "<type>: <lowercase imperative summary>"
   git push
   ```
2. One commit per feedback item, or one per coherent group when several comments
   concern the same issue; every commit must stand alone as the answer to review
   feedback. Nothing unrelated gets staged.
3. Use the repo's conventional-commit prefixes â€” `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`,
   `docs`, `chore` â€” lowercase imperative, explaining *why*:
   ```
   fix: wrap session writes in one room transaction (review)
   test: cover family shared last-played mapping (review)
   ```
4. Push normally to the PR head branch. Never force-push, never amend pushed
   commits, never rewrite history, never touch `master`. If a push is rejected
   because the remote moved, stop and ask.

Pushed commits appear on the PR automatically â€” nothing else needs to be attached.

### 7. Reply and report

1. Reply to each addressed review thread with the commit that resolved it (thread
   `id`s come from step 3):
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='
     mutation($threadId: ID!, $body: String!) {
       addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(
         input: {pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId, body: $body}
       ) { comment { url } }
     }' -f threadId=<id> -f body='Addressed in <short-sha> â€” <one-line summary>'
   ```
   Leave threads **unresolved**: in this repo a thread is resolved by the reviewer
   after re-review. Only resolve (via the `resolveReviewThread` mutation) when the
   user explicitly asks for it.
2. Final report:
   ```
   ## Follow-up complete

   **PR:** #<n> â€” <title> (<url>)

   | Feedback | Action | Commit |
   |---|---|---|
   | "<comment summary>" | what changed and why | <sha> |

   **Verification:** <tests/build commands and results>
   **Pushed:** âœ“ / âœ— (reason)
   ```

## Guardrails

- Never guess which PR â€” ambiguous prompts always get the open-PR picker.
- Never auto-select a historical/outdated comment; the user picks, and only after
  they explicitly directed the skill off the current head.
- No actionable comments on head and no explicit off-head direction â†’ reject with
  "there's no comment in the PR thread". No code changes, no commits.
- Stay on the PR head branch; never commit or push to `master` or another branch.
- Never force-push, amend pushed commits, or rewrite history.
- Never stage files unrelated to addressed feedback; never commit secrets or build
  artifacts (respect `.gitignore`).
- Never push code that fails verification; commit/push autonomy covers *how* and
  *when* to push, never pushing broken work. If verification cannot be made green,
  report and stop.
- Normative specs win: when feedback conflicts with `openspec/specs/`, ask before
  implementing.
- Report clearly what was addressed, how it was verified, and what was pushed.
